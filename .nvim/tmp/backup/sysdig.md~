# Sysdig

Universal System Visibility With Native Container Support

Sysdig is open source, system-level exploration: capture system state and activity from a running Linux instance,
then save, filter and analyze. Sysdig is scriptable in Lua and includes a command line interface and a powerful
interactive UI, csysdig, that runs in your terminal. Think of sysdig as strace + tcpdump + htop + iftop + lsof + awesome sauce.
With state of the art container visibility on top.

Show all running processes in my containers
```bash
sudo sysdig -pc container.id != host
```
